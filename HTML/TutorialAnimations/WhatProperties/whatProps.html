  <h1>What css properties can be transitioned?</h1>
  <p>Properties that can not be animated are the ones like: background-image, display, border-style, position, float, font-family</p>
  <p>
    The props that can be animated are the ones that are expressed in numbers, because they can be calculated.
    All the animation are actually math functions, they interpolate values though-out the animation.
    Also we can animate the properties that are expressed in colors because it's the same idea, we can interpolate for middle values.
